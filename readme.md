Syllabus Covered

1. Data Structures for Linear Algebra
2. Common Tensor Operations
3. Matrix Properties

## Section I - Data Structures for Linear Algebra
### Day 1
- Algebra is arithmetic that includes non-numerical entites like x
- If it has an exponential term, it isn't linear Algebra
- There are only three options in linear Algebra `one, no or infinite solutions`
- It is impossible for lines to cross multiple times

### Day 2
- **Tensors** : ML Generalizations of vector and matrices to any number of dimensions.


| Dimension | Mathematical Name  | Description  |
| :-:   | :-: | :-: |
| 0 | Scaler | Magnitude |
| 1 | Vector | Array |
| 2 | Matrix | Flat Table |
| 3 | 3-Tensor | 3D Table |
| n | n-Tensor | Higher Dimension |

Scaler in *Pytorch*
- Pytorch Sensors are designed to be Pythonic, i.e. to feel and behave like Numpy Arrays
- The advantages of Pytorch Tensords relative To Numpy array is that they can easy be used for operations on GPU

Learnt how Scaler can be used in Pytorch and Tensorflow
